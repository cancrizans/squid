			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>This document is a guide to the grammar and script of the language {Sôttao Nódare} (Nedarian) of the Squid People ({Bǎntoa Nódare}), specifically the variant spoken by immigrants on Earth.</p>

			<p>All off-planet variants of Nedarian descend from a single language known as {Aquatic Nedarian}, which was spoken underwater. Because of the limitations of sound transmission in water, the language boasted some unusual features, namely an atrophic consonantal inventory, no distinction of any vowel articulatory quality whatsoever (somewhat imprecisely termed a ``one-vowel language''), several loud implosive clicks, and a very complex system of tonality and length. In effect, Aquatic Nedarian was an almost completely musical language.</p>

			<p>As Nedarians progressively shifted to ground for daily life, many of these features mutated to redistribute themselves into the new space allowed by the sound transmission properties of air. All Nedarian languages retain a ``one-vowel'' system, as distinguishing vowel quality is biologically difficult for this species, but much of the ``musical'' aspects transformed into a more sophisticated consonantal inventory. All in all, the resulting {Surface Nedarian} family features languages with reasonable consonant inventories, "one-vowel", tonal systems with no length distinction, and simple phonotactics with open syllables.</p>

			<p>After contact with alien species, one can identify a general {Spacebound Nedarian} family spoken by off-planet Squid People. This then underwent significant fragmentation as the space-bound population spread across star system. Because of the specifics of their culture, creoles are unlikely, and influences of external languages on Nedarian is suppressed. Nevertheless, the family of {Colonial Nedarian} dialects evidences the effects of contact with the Reticulan language, and specifically {Earth Colonial Nedarian} ({ECN}) has developed unique features due to the isolation of the Earth Free State.</p>

			<p>{-} represents a null consonant, or vowel carrier. We remark %!% is a click sound, and ː represents gemination of the consonants.</p>

			<p>The vowel inventory is much reduced: there is only one vowel, rendered phonetically as %a% and in romanisation as any of {a}, {e}, {o} depending on tonal pattern described below<span class="cmnt">Explain this and also nasalisation</span>. More specifically, no frontness, openness nor roundess are distinguished phonemically - essentially all vowel sounds are considered to be valid realisations. The missing information is instead carried almost entirely in tone.</p>

			<p><span class="cmnt">Explain allophony</span></p>

			<p>Speech is divided in distinct words; the word is intended to include not just the base form but also all kind of postpositions. That the word boundary is not interrupted is specified with a dash instead of a space. Each word is composed of syllables which are strictly of the form CV, where C is one of consonant clusters above and V is simply a. The first syllable's consonant can be any from the "Medio-initial" or "Initial" columns (if C is -, then this means the word just starts with vowel), while for all following syllables one chooses from the "Medio-initial" and "Medial" columns. <span class="cmnt">Not completely satisfactory, continue</span></p>

			<p>To summarise these rules more simply, we can reword them as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Consonant clusters are always separated by a vowel.</li>
				<li>Two vowels are never adjacent within a word.</li>
				<li>Words always end in a vowel.</li>
				<li>Words cannot start in a geminated consonant</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There are some more precise rules on which consonants can be in adjacent syllables, but these are only applied in the base form themselves and can be broken by the addition of postpositions.</p>

			<h2>Tone Patterns</h2>

			<p>A great amount of information is carried in tone, specifically in word-level tone patterns (henceforth "tones"). There are eight possible word tones, corresponding to the three binary choices of high/low start, high/low end, and straight vs "bounced" transition.</p>

			<div class="center">
				<table class="compact_table">

			<p>The structure of tones is much more regular than it may appear. Straight tones consist of a uniform pitch shift from an initial to a final pitch. The bounced tones are composed of the same movement, which is then followed by a short leap into a middle pitch and then back to the regular end pitch.</p>

			<p>The tone has to be properly distributed through the syllables of the word, which we remind also includes any postpositions. The rule is that if possible each syllable is assigned a steady pitch, and gliding syllables are resorted to only when necessary. Straight tones offer no difficulty, as each word is at least two-syllables long. For the DIP and PEAK tones, in two-syllable words the first one is at the start pitch and the second is a glide, while with three and more there is no issue. For the TUMBLE and JUMP tones, in two-syllable words one resorts to two glides, and in three-syllable words the first two are steady and the last one is the glide. <span class="cmnt">Detail exceptions</span></p>

			<p>In romanisation, tone is represented by diacritics on the first vowel of the word, as follows: </p>

<!-- 
		<div class="center"><table class="compact_table uniformised_table">
			<tr>
				<td>HIGH</td>
				<td>FALL</td>
				<td>DIP</td>

		<p>Equivalently, we will refer to the tones also by the initial of their names, so respectively H F D T R L J P.</p>

		<h1>Grammar</h1>

		<h2>Syntax</h2>

		<p>All Nedarian languages display a specific flavor of strong ergativity that is comparatively rare in other natural languages, and is known historically as {aquatic ergativity}. This means in practice that the usual distinction between Subjects (S) and Direct Objects (O) of phrases does not really exist, and rather one distinguishes Agents (A) and Patients (P). Agents correspond to the subject of transitive clauses, while patients are either objects of transitive clauses or subject of intransitive ones. For example, in</p>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{kǎrnote}</td> <td>{bánto-wa}</td> <td>{tsȁne}</td></tr>
				<tr><td>apples</td> <td>person</td> <td>eat</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="translation">The person ate the apples</div>
		</div>

		<p>(where we have omitted all extra grammatical information for simplicity), "the person" is the Agent, and "the apples" are the patient. But in an intransitive clause like</p>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{hânto}</td> <td>{tsâttarne}</td> </tr>
				<tr><td>sun</td> <td>shines</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="translation">The sun shines</div>
		</div>

		<p>"the sun" is the Patient. This reflects in the whole language in the relationship the agents and patients have to the verbs. The general tendency to keep in mind is that clauses are generally thought of as composed of a patient and a verb (so, PV structure), with the verb being by default the most important component (head), and that agents are considered to be optional markings or properties of the verb itself. In fact, verbs themselves agree in gender with the patient, but are also inflected optionally for the person of the agent. This philosophy only partially explains the extremely bizarre default word order of {Object-Subject-Verb} (that is, Patient-Agent-Verb) for transitive clauses. The complete structure of the default order is as follows:</p>

		<div class="center bigger">
			(Indirect Object) - Patient - (Agent) - Verb
		</div>

		<p>However, since, as we will see, nouns will be marked for their role in a sentence, the order can be rearranged without risk of ambiguity. One simple motivation for rearrangement is emphasis. Colonial Nederian emphasises elements by placing them in final position. Note the following examples:</p>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr> <td>{bánto-wa}</td> <td>{tsȁne}</td> <td>{kǎrnote}</td></tr>
				<tr> <td>person</td> <td>eat</td> <td>apples</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="translation">The person ate _the apples_</div>
		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr>  <td>{kǎrnote}</td>  <td>{tsȁne}</td> <td>{bánto-wa}</td></tr>
				<tr>   <td>apples</td><td>eat</td><td>person</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="translation">_The person_ ate the apples</div>
		</div>

		<p>By placing the Patient and Agent respectively in final position, one brings emphasis. The meaning is roughly ``it is specifically the apples that the person ate'' and ``it was the person specifically that ate the apples''. For placing emphasis on the verb which is usually already final there's a weirder setup:</p>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr>  <td>{kārnote}</td> <td>{bǎnto-wa}</td> <td>{tsȁne-na}</td></tr>
				<tr>  <td>the apples</td> <td>the person</td> <td>eat</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="translation">The person _ate_ the apples</div>
		</div>

		<p>This introduces a confusing construct that we will see later, known as the antipassive. This essentially shifts the agent into a patient and the patient into an indirect. Performing this maneuver where it is not strictly necessary constitutes in itself emphasis for the verb.</p>

		<p>The marking of roles of nouns is through the use of case, which itself is determined through tones, as explained later. By default, Patients will be marked in the {Absolutive} case, while Agents will take on the {Dominant} case (which encompasses both the usual Ergative and Genitive cases). Reprising the first examples:</p>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{kǎrnote}</td> <td>{bánto-wa}</td> <td>{tsȁne}</td></tr>
				<tr><td>ABS.F.apples(COLL)</td> <td>ERG.F.person.SING</td> <td>F.3.PERF.eat</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="pronunciation">%Dkarnata Rbantawa Ttsana%</div>
			<div class="translation">The person ate the apples</div>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{hânto}</td> <td>{tsâttarne}</td> </tr>
				<tr><td>ABS.M.sun</td> <td>M.3.PERF.shines</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="pronunciation">%Phanta Ptsattarna%</div>
			<div class="translation">The sun shines</div>
		</div>

<!-- 		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{kàcha-ze}</td> <td>{Ǎyoka}</td></tr>
				<tr><td>ABL.F.house-in</td> <td>ABS.F.Ayaka</td></tr>
			</table>
			<div class="conscript">£kachaza _ayaka£</div> 
			<div class="pronunciation">%Fkachaza Dayaka%</div>
			<div class="translation">Ayaka is in the house</div>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<table>
				<tr><td>{kǎrnote}</td> <td>{Áyaka}</td> <td>{tsàne}</td></tr>
				<tr><td>ABS.F.apples(COLL)</td> <td>ERG.F.Ayaka</td> <td>eat</td></tr>
			</table>
			 <div class="conscript">£karnata ayaka tsana£</div> 
			<div class="pronunciation">%Dkarnata Rayaka Ftsana%</div>
			<div class="translation">Ayaka ate the apples</div>
		</div> -->


		<h2>Nouns</h2>

		<p>Nouns are declensed by gender and case through tonal inflection. Specifically, one combines declensed case and postpositions as follows:</p>

		<div class="center">
			<table class="compact_table">
				<tr><td>Absolutive (trans. object, intr. subject)  </td><td> (unmarked)  </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Ergative (trans. subject) </td><td rowspan="2"> DOM</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Genitive (possession) </td></tr> 
				<tr><td>Locative (location) </td><td> ABL + {-za} </td></tr> 
				<tr><td>Instrumental </td><td> ABL </td></tr> 
				<tr><td>Perlative (movement through) </td><td rowspan="3"> TRANS </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Malefactive (to the detriment of) </td></tr>
				<tr><td>Essive (temporarily as) </td></tr> 
				<tr><td><span class="cmnt">Severely incomplete... continue</span></td></tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>and then the case and gender are marked in the word tone as follows:</p>

		<div class="center" >
			<table class="compact_table">
				
				<tr><th> Case </th><th> Code  </th><th> Masculine </th><th> Feminine </th></tr>
				<tr><td>null/Absolutive </td><td> (unmarked) </td><td> P  </td><td> D </td></tr> 
				<tr><td>Dominant </td><td> DOM </td><td> R  </td><td> R</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Ablative </td><td> ABL </td><td>  L     </td><td> F</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Transitional </td><td> TRANS </td><td> L </td><td> L</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Indirect </td><td> IND </td><td> H </td><td> H </td> </tr>
			</table>
		</div>


		<h3>Number</h3>

		It's important to understand that the base form of a noun already carries an inherent number. This can be as follows

		<ul>
			<li> <span class="bold">Singular</span>, which is the case for proper nouns and some common nouns. For example {kanyatsa} ``arm'', can be pluralised as {kanyatsa-she} ``arms''.</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Collective</span>, which is the case for {most} common nouns. For example {banta} ``persons'' is inherently plural, referring to some unspecified amount of people or to people in general, and by modifying with a <span class="bold">singulative</span> postposition we have {banta-wa} ``person''.</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Mass nouns</span>, like {gaxa} ``water''.</li>
			<li> <span class="bold">Set nouns</span> can be confusing. These refer to a set of objects that usually come in a predetermined number, almost always a pair. The set noun is typically the simplest form, and it itself can be singular or collective, with a preference for the latter. For example, {tsadara} ``pairs of eyes'' is a Collective Pair noun. It can be singularised as {tsadara-wa} ``pair of eyes'' in which case it refers to a single pair, or it can be <span class="bold">split</span> as {tsadara-nte} ``eye'' which then becomes a singular noun for the single element, which in turn we can pluralise as {tsadara-nta-she} ``eyes''.</li>
		</ul>

		In addition, one can employ other number specifiers to singular or collective nouns. 

		<div class="center"><table class="compact_table">
			<tr><th>Postposition </th><th> Effect/meaning </th><th> Applies to </th></tr>  
			<tr><td>{-sha}     </td><td> Pluraliser </td><td> Singular  </td></tr>
			<tr><td>{-wa} </td><td> Singulariser </td><td> Collective </td></tr>
			<tr><td>{-nta}   </td><td> Splitter </td><td> Set </td></tr>  
			<tr><td>{-shara} </td><td> Two (Dual)  </td><td rowspan="4"> All</td></tr>
			<tr><td>{-satza} </td><td> Three (``Trial'') </td></tr>
			<tr><td>{-baka} </td><td> All (Categorical) </td> </tr>
			<tr><td>{-shama} </td><td> Some of </td> </tr>
		</table></div>

		<p>Collective nouns can have irregular singularisations, usually involving reduplication. For example {dakawasa} ``coins'' singularises as {dakawasa-sa} ``coin'' instead of the ungrammatical {dakawasa-wa}. These irregular forms are specified in the lexicon.</p>

		<p>Set nouns are always masculine, and the split forms are always feminine. Non-set nouns can be masculine or feminine, and all other number postpositions do not affect gender.</p>


		<h3>Gender Classes</h3>

		<p>ECN has two grammatical genders called {Masculine} and {Feminine}, as they match with biological gender for (individual) persons or animals. All other nouns, including nouns referring to categories or groups of persons or animals, are assigned a grammatical gender in a way that may appear quite arbitrary. In addition, some nouns may have {both genders} and have two different (related) meanings depending on the gender they are inflected for, something that will be explained better later as part of Morphological Derivation.</p>

		<p>The following ``soft'' rules for gender assignment tend to cover most of the lemmas in the language, though many exceptions are featured:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Proper nouns and nouns referring to persons or animals of specific gender always have the matching gender.</li>
			<li>The following are usually {Feminine}
				<ul>
					<li>Inanimate objects that are not parts or components of others</li>
					<li>Natural objects, plants, fruits</li>
					<li>Members of categories of people, like nouns for members of a specific profession</li>
					<li>Collective parts or components (like body parts) that are not set nouns</li>
					<li>Split form of set nouns</li>
					<li>Mass nouns for liquids</li>
					<li>Valuable objects, currency</li>
					<li>Appliances, vehicles, establishments</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The following are usually {Masculine}
				<ul>
					<li>Places, abstract concepts, feelings</li>
					<li>Objects that are usually unique, like celestial bodies</li>
					<li>Professions, groups of people, relationships</li>
					<li>Mass nouns for solids, like soils, minerals, metals</li>
					<li>Food and drinks</li>
					<li>Tools</li>
					<li>Singular parts or components (like body parts) that are not set nouns</li>
					<li>Set nouns in unsplit form</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Adjectives</h2>
		<h2>Verbs</h2>

		<p>Verbs are conjugated for {aspect}, {mood}, and the {gender of the patient}, but not for tense. This conjugation is effected through tone. In addition, verbs can be marked by {person of the agent} through prepositions. The latter are essentially fossilised pronouns that have been absorbed by the verb in the standard OSV position, but in the current form of ECN they have to be considered as part of the verb for all intents and purposes, and can result in some irregularities due to phonetic shifts.</p>

		<p>The tonal conjugation is as follows:</p>

		<div class="center"><table class="compact_table">
			<tr><td class="hide"></td><td colspan="2">Masculine Patient</td><td colspan="2">Feminine Patient</td></tr>
			<tr><td class="hide"></td><td>Perfect</td><td>Imperfect</td> <td>Perfect</td><td>Imperfect</td> </tr>
			<tr><td>Indicative</td><td>F</td><td>P</td><td>T</td><td>H</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Subjunctive</td><td>R</td> <td>J</td> <td>R</td> <td>J</td> </tr>
			<tr><td>Negative</td> <td>L</td> <td>L</td> <td>D</td> <td>D</td> </tr>
		</table></div>

		<p>This bizarre system originated in the old Aquatic verb conjugation system based on triconsonantal roots and per-syllable tone/length markings. In its current version it has become remarkably regular.</p>

		<p>The {Indicative} mood is simply for factual statements or positive beliefs. The {Subjunctive} is for hypothetical statements, desires, conditional sentences (in particular, ECN does not distinguish a Conditional mood). The {Negative} is employed for negation, questions, and a few other uses that will be clarified subsequently.</p>
