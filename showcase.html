				Naderian is a conlang developed for a psychedelic-scifi <strong>webcomic</strong>* that has been running since 2018. It's the language of the Naderians, or Squid People, one of the many humanoid alien species in the fictional world.
			</div>
			<div class="infoboxlet">
				Planet Earth has been invaded by Reticulan Grey aliens and turned into a colonial regime. The amphibian Squid People have been introduced to colonial Earth initially as slaves, along with many other species. In the 24th century they are unique in that they have not assimilated into Reticulan culture and have preserved their own language.
			</div>
			<div class="infoboxlet">
				Squid People are very similar to humans in many physiological aspects, but their <strong>hearing and sight have been altered</strong> by a long period of underwater residence on their native planet Nadare. This shaped their original almost entirely <strong>musical proto-language</strong>, and currently affects their speaking. As they moved to the surface and spread throughout space the language mutated into the present form developing some naturalistic features of ground-dwelling languages, while mantaining many distinctly alien quirks.
