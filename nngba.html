			<p>Nngba is written using only ASCII characters, and can be written on most typewriters. The romanisation is as follows:</p>


			<table class="compact_table unicode_font">
				<tr><td>ŋ</td><td>ŋ͡m</td><td>k͡p</td><td>ɡ͡b</td><td>ʘ</td><td>ʔ</td><td>n̩</td><td>z̩</td><td>ə</td><td>ɔ</td><td>Long vowels</td></tr>
				<tr><td>n</td><td>nm</td><td>kp</td><td>gb</td><td>=</td><td>'</td><td>n</td><td>z</td><td>e</td><td>o</td><td>double letters</td></tr>
			</table>

			<p>Everything else uses the same symbol as in the IPA. Some may also romanise <span class="ipa">ŋ͡m</span> as ngm, but the g glyph is not really necessary as the sequence <span class="ipa">nm</span> (with non-syllabic n) cannot occur.</p>

			<!--<p>It should always be pretty clear when n is a consonant or a syllabic. A single n flanked by other consonants/spaces can only be a short syllabic. Sequence nn, unless it's nnm, can only be a long syllabic. </p>-->

			<h3>Syntax and Topic-comment</h3>

			<p>Nngba is <strong>topic-prominent</strong>, which means it puts weight on the distinction between the <em>topic</em> of a sentence, which is what is being talked about, and the <em>comment</em>, which is what it's being said about it. The topic is placed at the beginning of phrases:</p>

			<p><strong>Dui glokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<p>Imagine we want to communicate something slightly different. For example, someone asks "who speaks Nngba here?" and you want to reply "I speak Nngba", as in "Nngba is spoken by me". Even if grammatically the sentence is the same as before, we reinterpret it with Nngba as the topic and "I speak it" as the comment. So it would be said</p>

			<p><strong>Nngba dui glokpe.</strong> </p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<h3>Inverse alignment</h3>

			<p>Nngba has a specific alignment system which is vaguely of the Direct-Inverse class and it's designed to prevent repeating particles appearing in a way that could betray the presence of noun classes or hierarchies, while still being relatively if not incredibly simple to work out if you know it already. In a sentence like this</p>

			<p><strong>Dui gboo!n maambe.</strong> </p>
			<p>1s eat pear</p>
			<p>I eat a pear.</p>

			<p>it's not really necessary to mark subject and object with either syntax (word order) or morphology (case marking or inflections). It's clear that since "I" is more animate than "pear" it's very likely going to be that I eat the pear rather than the pear eating me, so this is the <em>default</em> reading of sentences. In general there is a specific <strong>indexability hierarchy</strong> of arguments; when there are multiple arguments in a sentence, the outranking one is intended as subject and the other as object.</p>

			<p>If we want to mark specifically that the hierarchy is being inverted, for example we want to say "the pear eats me", we use a specific <strong>Inverse</strong> marker. But this marker is placed on the verb instead of on the arguments (if it was placed on one of the args, it would betray their position in the hierarchy and thus possibly other information about their true meaning, and if it was placed on both, it could risk being too repetitive and easily identified).</p>

			<p><strong>Dui gboo!ndi maambe.</strong> </p>
			<p>1s eat-INV pear</p>
			<p>The pear eats me</p>


			<h3>Verb bracketing</h3>

			<p>A classical "encryption" feature of Nngba is to insert non-topic arguments <em>inside</em> of verbs with multiple syllables, called somewhat imprecisely verb bracketing. For example</p>

			<p><strong>Dui gloNngbakpe.</strong> </p>
			<p>1s sp-Nngba-eak.</p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<h3>Bipronouns</h3>

			<p>Crazy idea: it happens very often that sentences involve two or more pronouns ("gimme that", "I hated it", "You told me"). What if two pronouns could be encrypted in a single word (bipronoun)? It could be hard for a non-speaker to split apart the two combining pronouns but there could be a relatively simple system to put them together. This limits word repetition (the "you" of "you told Anna" doesn't sound similar to the "you" of "you told me").</p>
