			<p><span class="ipa">z̩n̩</span> is also classified as a diphthong because why not. Diphthongs are as long as a long vowel. <span>/ai ui/</span> are allophonic with <span>[aːj uːj]</span> and <span>/au ua/</span> with <span class="ipa">[aːw waː]</span>. There are no distinct <span class="ipa">/j w/</span> phonemes.</p>



			<p><span class="ipa">/n ~ l ~ ɳ ~ ŋ/</span> are allophonic variations or contextual realisations of a single phoneme/archiphoneme, call it <span class="ipa">/N/</span>. Depending on context, it's pronounced as</p>

			<p>Note that in the rare case <span class="ipa">/Ngm/</span> which is <span class="ipa">/ŋgm/</span> this is not phonemically distinct from <span class="ipa">/ŋ͡m/</span>. When <span class="ipa">/N/</span> occurs before a syllabic <span class="ipa">/n̩/</span>, it is always pronounced as <span class="ipa">/ln̩/</span> independently of context.

			<p>Nngba is written using only ASCII characters, and can be written on most typewriters. The romanisation is as follows:</p>


			<table class="compact_table unicode_font">
				<tr><td>ʈ</td><td>ɖ</td><td>ɳ</td><td>ŋ</td><td>ŋ͡m</td><td>k͡p</td><td>ɡ͡b</td><td>ʘ</td><td>ʔ</td><td>n̩</td><td>z̩</td><td>ə</td><td>ɔ</td><td>Long vowels</td></tr>
				<tr><td>tt</td><td>dd</td><td>n</td><td>n</td><td>nm</td><td>kp</td><td>gb</td><td>=</td><td>'</td><td>n</td><td>z</td><td>e</td><td>o</td><td>double letters</td></tr>
			</table>

			<p>Everything else uses the same symbol as in the IPA. Some may also romanise <span class="ipa">ŋ͡m</span> as ngm, but the g glyph is not really necessary as the sequence <span class="ipa">nm</span> (with non-syllabic n) cannot occur.</p>

			<!--<p>It should always be pretty clear when n is a consonant or a syllabic. A single n flanked by other consonants/spaces can only be a short syllabic. Sequence nn, unless it's nnm, can only be a long syllabic. </p>-->

			<h3>Syntax and Topic-comment</h3>

			<p>Nngba is <strong>topic-prominent</strong>, which means it puts weight on the distinction between the <em>topic</em> of a sentence, which is what is being talked about, and the <em>comment</em>, which is what it's being said about it. The topic is placed at the beginning of phrases:</p>

			<p><strong>Dui glokpe Nngba.</strong> </p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<p>Imagine we want to communicate something slightly different. For example, someone asks "who speaks Nngba here?" and you want to reply "I speak Nngba", as in "Nngba is spoken by me". Even if grammatically the sentence is the same as before, we reinterpret it with Nngba as the topic and "I speak it" as the comment. So it would be said</p>

			<p><strong>Nngba dui glokpe.</strong> </p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<h3>Inverse alignment</h3>

			<em>Inspired by some Meso- and North American languages (ex. Huastec, Algonquian, Navajo...) </em>

			<p>Nngba has a specific alignment system which is vaguely of the Direct-Inverse class and it's designed to prevent repeating particles appearing in a way that could betray the presence of noun classes or hierarchies, while still being relatively if not incredibly simple to work out if you know it already. In a sentence like this</p>

			<p><strong>Dui gboo!n maambe.</strong> 1s eat pear <em>I eat a pear.</em></p>

			<p>it's not really necessary to mark subject and object with either syntax (word order) or morphology (case marking or inflections). It's clear that since "I" is more animate than "pear" it's very likely going to be that I eat the pear rather than the pear eating me, so this is the <em>default</em> reading of sentences. In general there is a specific <strong>indexability hierarchy</strong> of arguments; when there are multiple arguments in a sentence, the outranking one is intended as subject and the other as object.</p>

			<p>If we want to mark specifically that the hierarchy is being inverted, for example we want to say "the pear eats me", we use a specific <strong>Inverse</strong> marker. But this marker is placed on the verb instead of on the arguments (if it was placed on one of the args, it would betray their position in the hierarchy and thus possibly other information about their true meaning, and if it was placed on both, it could risk being too repetitive and easily identified).</p>

			<p><strong>Dui gboo!ndi maambe.</strong> 1s eat-INV pear <em>The pear eats me</em></p>

			<p>To figure out ranking</p>

			<ol> 
				<li>

					<p class="bigger">verb-compatible > verb-incompatible</p>


					<p>That is if it is really unusual for one of the arguments to have been the subject, it gets outranked. (In "The wolf mauled the rabbit", the wolf outranks the rabbit since the rabbit is probably incompatible with mauling). <em>Then</em> if there is still a tie, you look at</p>
				</li>

				<li>		
					<p class="bigger">second person > first person > people > animals > inanimates and abstract concepts</p>


					<p>So if I say "I you see" the meaning is "you see me" because 2nd person outranks first. I need to invert if I want "I see you". But then if there is <em>still</em> a tie, one looks at:</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="bigger"> proximal > obviative</p>

					<p>Which means that proximal arguments, that is things already introduced and that we are referring back to always outrank the others (obviatives) (e.g. in the second clause of "There was a dog, and the dog saw the bear", the dog outranks the bear).</p>

				</li>
				<li>

					<p>If and only if there is still a tie in rank (and it can definitely happen often) we can mark the subject with an <strong>ergative</strong>, which I'd like to call a <strong>desperative</strong>, because you really want to have to do this as little as possible - it's a liability. It can be marked with final reduplication, so say <strong>bzzke</strong> "wolf" could become <strong>bzzkeke</strong> "wolf.ERG".</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Verb bracketing</h3>

			<p>A classical "encryption" feature of Nngba is to insert non-topic arguments <em>inside</em> of verbs with multiple syllables, called somewhat imprecisely verb bracketing. For example</p>

			<p><strong>Dui glo'Nngbakpe.</strong> </p>
			<p>1s sp-Nngba-eak.</p>
			<p>I speak Nngba.</p>

			<h3>Bipronouns</h3>

			<p>Crazy idea: it happens very often that sentences involve two or more pronouns ("gimme that", "I hated it", "You told me"). What if two pronouns could be encrypted in a single word (bipronoun)? It could be hard for a non-speaker to split apart the two combining pronouns but there could be a relatively simple system to put them together. This limits word repetition (the "you" of "you told Anna" doesn't sound similar to the "you" of "you told me").</p>

<!-- 			<h3>Trigger registers</h3>

			<p>Very very crazy idea. Imagine some sentences are kind of in a "flipped" register. It could be every other sentence, as in the sequence would be implicitly straight, flipped, straight, flipped... or flipped sentences could be marked with a particle.</p>

			<p>In a flipped sentence, all words or some words get their sounds flipped in some way (like labials to velars, or "a" to "u"). These words would come in flipped pairs with different meaning, so that only if you are aware of the overall flip you can disambiguate between the two. (Stupid ) Trying to decipher this as a regular language would fail.</p>

			<p>This idea sounds really impractical to think about though and really doesn't fit with the theme</p> -->
